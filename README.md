# Bug Tracker

A GitHub repository to manage and track bugs efficiently, developed using separate `frontend` and `backend` branches. This project demonstrates effective Git collaboration, merge conflict resolution, and usage of conventional commits for a clean and structured commit history.

## ðŸ”€ Branch Structure

- `main`: The primary branch where stable code resides.
- `frontend`: Contains all frontend-related code.
- `backend`: Contains backend logic and services.

## âœ… Pull Requests

- At least one pull request has been successfully **merged** after resolving a **merge conflict** manually.
- Conflict occurred in `index.html` during a pull from the remote `main` branch.
- Conflict was resolved and committed properly.

## ðŸ§¾ Git Commit Convention

This project follows **Conventional Commits** to ensure a clean and meaningful history. Example:
```bash
feat: added css to main
fix: Tracker name change
